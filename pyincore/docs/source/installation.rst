Installing pyIncore
===================

Please read through the instructions at least once completely before actually following them to avoid any installation problems!

**pyIncore** uses the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (`GDAL <https://www.gdal.org/>`_), which in most cases has to be installed separately. The GDAL installation is global on Windows and Linux, even if you use virtual environments.

The following are GDAL and pyIncore installation instructions for each operating system as well as steps on how to edit and store user credentials file.
