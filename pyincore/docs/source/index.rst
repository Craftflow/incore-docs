IN-CORE pyincore
================

**Pyincore** is a Python package to analyze and visualize various hazard (earthquake, tornado, hurricane etc.)
scenarios developed by the Center for Risk-Based Community Resilence Planning team from NCSA.
The development is part of NIST sponsored IN-CORE (Interdependent Networked Community Resilience Modeling
Environment) initiative. Pyincore allows users to apply hazards on infrastructure in selected areas.
Python framework acceses underlying data through local or remote services and facilitates moving
and synthesizing results.

**Pyincore** as a python module can be used to write hazard workflow tools. We envision users writing tools
as `Jupyter <https://jupyter.org/>`_ notebooks.
