## IN-CORE Web Tools

**IN-CORE Web Tools** are used for interacting with the service layer. They enable users to browse and search the **Datasets**, **Hazards** and **Damages**, **Fragilities**, **Repairs**, **Restorations** and **Recoveries** (collectively referred to as **DFR3**), view the metadata and visualizations, and download the datasets.

The **In-Core Web Tools** is a dashboard with viewers and explorers for various services. Currently these are [Datasets](https://incore2.ncsa.illinois.edu/DataViewer), [Hazards](https://incore2.ncsa.illinois.edu/HazardViewer) and [DFR3](https://incore2.ncsa.illinois.edu/FragilityViewer) services covering the processing, visualization and manipulation of data (objects). The dashboard can be accessed directly from the [IN-CORE page](https://incore2.ncsa.illinois.edu/).
This section shows how to access IN-CORE Web Tools and documentation on IN-CORE Lab.
