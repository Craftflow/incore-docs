## Introduction

![IN-CORE name and logo](images/incore0.png)

**IN-CORE** is an acronym which stands for the **I**nterdependent **N**etworked **Co**mmunity
**R**esilience Modeling **E**nvironment, a scientific platform for programming and running analyses 
that model the impact of natural hazards on communities and their resilience considering interacting physical 
infrastructure, social, and economic systems. Funding for the development and maintenance of [IN-CORE](http://resilience.colostate.edu/in_core.shtml) was provided 
as part of Cooperative Agreement 70NANB15H044 between the National Institute of Standards and Technology ([NIST](https://www.nist.gov/)) 
and Colorado State University ([CSU](https://www.colostate.edu/)).

**pyIncore** is a Python package to analyze and visualize various hazard scenarios (earthquake, tornado, hurricane etc.) 
developed in the Center for Risk-Based Community Resilence Planning, which can be modified by users. 
pyIncore allows users to apply hazards to infrastructure in selected areas, propagating the effect of physical 
infrastructure damage and loss of functionality to social and economic impacts.  The Python framework obtains 
underlying data through local or remote services, processes them and facilitates sharing of results.

**IN-CORE Lab** is a customized Jupyter Lab with **pyIncore** installed on a server at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications ([NCSA](http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/)) for running and editing
various analyses as Jupyter Notebooks.

**IN-CORE Web Tools** is a set of web viewers and explorers for interacting with the IN-CORE servicea, data access layers on 
the shared server. The viewers enable users to browse and search **Datasets**, **Hazards** and **Damages**, **Fragilities**, 
**Repairs**, **Restorations**, **Recoveries** (referred to as **DFR3**), view the metadata and visualizations, and download the datasets.
