## Advanced

These tutorials cover advanced topics for experienced **IN-CORE** users and developers using **pyIncore** codebase,
and [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface)) endpoint definitions  which can be used for accessing 
services in development of new analyses (see [Technical References](refs.md))

(Comming soon)

### Running files locally.

An analysis, by default downloads dataset, dfr3 and mapping files from IN-CORE service. This tutorial introduces users to the basic concept 
of running the **pyIncore** analysis by loading datasets from local files (instead of remote datasets) as well as local support of 
dfr3 curves and infrastructure mappings.

### Create mapping between fragilities and infrastructure.

This tutorial shows examples of how to create fragility, restoration and repair curves.

### Upload datasets to the IN-CORE service.

This tutorial describes how to use a [REST API](https://restfulapi.net/) 
(**RE**presentational **S**tate **T**ransfer and **A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterface) 
clients to upload datasets to IN-CORE service.
