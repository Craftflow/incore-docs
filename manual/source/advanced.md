These tutorials cover advanced topics for experienced **IN-CORE** users and **pyIncore** developers.

###Running files locally



###Create mapping


###Upload datasets to the IN-CORE service.

This tutorial describes how to use a [REST API](https://restfulapi.net/) (**RE**presentational **S**tate **T**ransfer and **A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterface) clients to upload datasets to IN-CORE service.

We recommend using in-browser extensions which are are available for any major Internet browser 
such as [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [RESTer](https://github.com/frigus02/RESTer). You can however use any stand 
alone packaged applications as well. In any case the app should be able to 

- Perform HTTP requests with any method (`GET`, `POST` ...), URL, body and custom headers.
- Create and save your authorization headers with Basic or OAuth2 authentication.
- Save and organize requests foruser's convenience.
