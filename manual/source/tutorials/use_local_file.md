### Loading input files locally.

These tutorials cover advanced topics for experienced **IN-CORE** users and developers using **pyIncore** codebase,
and [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface)) endpoint definitions  which can be used for accessing 
services in development of new analyses (see [Technical References](../refs.md))

An analysis, by default downloads dataset, dfr3 and mapping files from IN-CORE service. This tutorial introduces users to the basic concept 
of running the **pyIncore** analysis by loading datasets from local files (instead of remote datasets) as well as local support of 
dfr3 curves and infrastructure mappings.
