## Tutorials and Tips

**Introduction**

This page contains more in-depth guides for using **pyIncore** and IN-CORE system in general. It is broken up into introductory
and advanced sections.

You may use these tutorials as a self-paced course to learn the platform thoroughly. However, each section is fairly independent,
so those already familiar with pyIncore can jump into any section.

You can also check out IN-CORE resources for other materials to help you navigate through terminology and practices, and a `FAQ section <faq.md />`_ in this Manual.
We encourage IN-CORE users to contribute improve the knowledge base. contact us with suggestions for expanding and extending Tutorials.

### Create earthquake and visualize building damage.

This tutorial is an examples of how to create an earthquake and use mapping between fragilities and 
building infrastructure.

### Combine building, bridge damage and pipelines damages.

In this tutorial we add bridges and pipelines to show complex infrastructure damages.

### Impact of hazard on social structure and economy.

This tutorial shows data aggregation and tabulated results for house unit allocation and 
population dislocation as well as economic impact caused by the hazard.

### Loading input files locally.

These tutorials cover advanced topics for experienced **IN-CORE** users and developers using **pyIncore** codebase,
and [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface)) endpoint definitions  which can be used for accessing 
services in development of new analyses (see [Technical References](../refs.md))

An analysis, by default downloads dataset, dfr3 and mapping files from IN-CORE service. This tutorial introduces users to the basic concept 
of running the **pyIncore** analysis by loading datasets from local files (instead of remote datasets) as well as local support of 
dfr3 curves and infrastructure mappings.

### Create mapping between fragilities and infrastructure.

This tutorial shows examples of how to create fragility, restoration and repair curves.

### Upload datasets to the IN-CORE service.

This tutorial describes how to use a [REST API](https://restfulapi.net/) 
(**RE**presentational **S**tate **T**ransfer and **A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterface) 
clients to upload datasets to IN-CORE service.
