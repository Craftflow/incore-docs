We provide documentation on three components of IN_CORE framework; this overview of the system, services and tools, 
documentation of IN-COREâ€™s Application programming interface and description of pyIncore Python modules. The last two 
are intended mainly for IN-CORE developers.

Application programming interface ([API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface)) of Incore is
at <https://incore2.ncsa.illinois.edu/doc/api/>). The API endpoints definitions can be used for accessing **Fragility**,
**Data** and **Hazard** services in development of new analyses.

Description of [pyIncore modules](../../pyincore) is referenced from the main Table of Contents.
