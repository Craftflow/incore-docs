IN-CORE pyincore
================

Pyincore is a Python package to analyze and visualize various hazard
(earthquake, tornado, hurricane etc.) scenarios developed by the Center for Risk-Based
Community Resilence Planning team from NCSA.
The development is part of NIST sponsored IN-CORE (Interdependent
Networked Community Resilience Modeling Environment) initiative.

Pyincore allows users to apply hazards on infrastructure in selected
areas. Python framework acceses underlying data through local
or remote services and facilitiates moving and synthesizing results.
