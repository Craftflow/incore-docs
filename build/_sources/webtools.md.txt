## IN-CORE Web Tools

**IN-CORE Web Tools** are for interacting with the service layer. They enable users to browse and search the **Datasets**, **Hazards** and **Fragilities**, view the metadata and visualizations, and download the datasets.

The In-Core Web Tools are a dashboard with viewers for various services. Currently these are **Fragility**, **Data** and **Hazard** services. The dashboard can be accessed directly at https://incore2.ncsa.illinois.edu/incore/ and on `IN-CORE Lab <incore_lab.html>`_
