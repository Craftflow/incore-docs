![IN-CORE name and logo](images/incore0.png)

**IN-CORE** is an acronym of Interdependent Networked Community Resilience Modeling Environment, a scientific platform for running scientific analyses that model the impact of natural hazards and resiliency against
the impact on communities. The development is part of NIST sponsored initiative.

**pyIncore** is a Python package to analyze and visualize various hazard (earthquake, tornado, hurricane etc.)
scenarios developed by the Center for Risk-Based Community Resilence Planning team from NCSA. PyIncore allows users to apply hazards on infrastructure in selected areas.
Python framework acceses underlying data through local or remote services and facilitates moving
and synthesizing results.

**pyincore** as a Python module can be used to develop scientific analysis/algorithm.

**IN-CORE Lab** is a customized Jupyter Lab with **pyIncore** installed on NCSA's server for running and editing
various analyses as Jupyter Notebooks.

**IN-CORE Web Tools** is a set of web viewers for interacting with the IN-CORE service layer.
The viewers enable users to browse and search the **Datasets**, **Hazards** and **Fragilities**,
view the metadata and visualizations, and download the datasets.
